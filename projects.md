    This low-fidelity Prototype was created using PowerPoint, and it was an entry for a re-designing of the infamous 'craigslist' homepage.</br>  
    My aim for this project was to make it less overwhelming for new users to access this website, while finding a way to challenge power users.</br>  
    This in turn led me to create this design since it would incorporate a list when you hover over the icons accessed to stick true to the brand name.

<div class= "myAngle" style="text-align: center">
<h3 align="center">My Angle</h3>
<p id="myAngle" style="text-align: center">
    My main focus was to retain pre-existing users of 'craigslist' while updating the UI to a more modern aesthetic.</br>
    I chose to handle these elements in a similar manner as mentioned in the article. Firstly, the incentive that I wanted to give to the use in order</br>
    for them to use the application more was by providing a more manageable layout while using the brand's colours. In order, to give the nostalgia of</br>
    the old website. I believe by including the list over hovering on each category helps with this.</br>
    For the motivation aspect I sought to emphasize the search feature more as to make it more noticeable since search bars are very handy in order to quickly convey the users emotions.</br>
    Futhermore, I decided to round out any rectangular edges to signal affordances, so that the users know that it would be interactable.
